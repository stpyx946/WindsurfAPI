# WindsurfAPI Docs

## Start Here

- [Maintainer Status](HANDOFF.md): current state, open issues, next priority
  order, VPS entrypoint notes, and hard boundaries for maintenance work.
- [Maintainer Notes](MAINTAINER_NOTES.md): persistent quality, release,
  security, native bridge, SWE, WebFetch, code, and UI working rules.

## Current State And Audits

- [Audits index](audits/): dated point-in-time audits.
- [Audit 2026-06-07](audits/AUDIT_2026-06-07.md): current open issue triage,
  priority order, SWE-1.6 plan, and WebSearch/WebFetch plan.
- [Audit 2026-06-06](audits/AUDIT_2026-06-06.md): prior hardening audit for
  release metadata, dashboard pagination, native bridge, and HTTP ingress.

## Protocol And Product Notes

- [Architecture Review](review.html): project map from startup to HTTP routes,
  protocol bridge, account/LS pools, dashboard, security boundaries, tests,
  and core runtime behavior.
- [Native Bridge Protocol Notes](native-bridge-protocol-notes.md): protobuf and
  runtime trace notes for native bridge protocol work.
- [Dashboard i18n](dashboard-i18n.md): dashboard localization notes.
- [analysis-v1.9.5](analysis-v1.9.5.md): older historical analysis. Treat it
  as background, not current truth.

## Release History

- [Release notes index](releases/): release-specific changes.
- Release notes are append-only history. Put current status or roadmap changes
  in `HANDOFF.md` / `audits/`, not in old release notes.

## Generated Site

  the canonical place for operational status.
- [review.html](review.html): public architecture review page.
