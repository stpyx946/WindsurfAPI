/**
 * Strip server-internal filesystem paths from model output before it reaches
 * the API caller.
 *
 * Background: Cascade's baked-in system context tells the model its workspace
 * lives at /tmp/windsurf-workspace. Even after we removed CascadeToolConfig
 * .run_command (see windsurf.js buildCascadeConfig) the model still
 *   (a) narrates "I'll look at /tmp/windsurf-workspace/config.yaml" in plain
 *       text, and
 *   (b) occasionally emits built-in edit_file / view_file / list_directory
 *       trajectory steps whose argumentsJson references these paths.
 * Both routes leak the proxy's internal filesystem layout to API callers.
 *
 * This module provides two scrubbers:
 *   - sanitizeText(s)        — one-shot, use on accumulated buffers
 *   - PathSanitizeStream     — incremental, use on streaming chunks
 *
 * The streaming version holds back any tail that could be an incomplete
 * prefix of a sensitive literal OR a match-in-progress whose path-tail hasn't
 * hit a terminator yet, so a path cannot slip through by straddling a chunk
 * boundary.

// Current marker is structural and explicit: it tells the user/model the
// workspace path is intentionally hidden, without looking like a real absolute
// path or a literal ellipsis answer. The proto/tool preamble also tells the
// model not to answer project-path questions by echoing this marker.
